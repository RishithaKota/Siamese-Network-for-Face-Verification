# Siamese-Network-for-Face-Verification
This project builds a Siamese face verification system trained with triplet loss. A shared CNN learns embeddings that pull same-person faces closer and push different identities apart. Using a Kaggle dataset and online triplet mining, the TensorFlow model is evaluated via face-pair verification using ROC and AUC.
